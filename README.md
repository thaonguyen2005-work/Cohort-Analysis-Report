# About the Project:  
## Overview of the data: 

TheLook is an e-commerce platform specializing in clothing, and the dataset includes information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events, and digital marketing campaigns.

The Look dataset includes:

**Orders Table**: Records all customer orders.

**Order_items Table**: Lists the items purchased in each order.

**Products Table**: Contains details of products sold, including price, brand, and product categories.

In this project, I utilized advanced SQL techniques such as subqueries, CTES, and Window Functions to process and analyze e-commerce data for TheLook. I developed and maintained datasets to track key performance indicators such as monthly order volume, customer acquisition, average order value, and product profitability. Additionally, I also performed cohort analysis and created visualizations to explore customer cohorts and user retention and churn patterns over time, providing valuable insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
