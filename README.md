# Sales-Analysis-Report
This is my personal project utilizing  SQL to clean and process a sales database, detecting outliers 
and improving data accuracy.

In this project, I employed advanced SQL techniques such as subqueries, CTEs, JOIN, and Window Functions to conduct in-depth
analysis of key metrics and R-F-M Analysis to identify sale trends.
