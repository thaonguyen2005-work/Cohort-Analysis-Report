# About the Project:  
## Overview of the data: 

TheLook is an e-commerce platform specializing in clothing, and the dataset includes information about customers, products, orders, logistics, web events, and digital marketing campaigns.

The Look dataset includes:

**Orders Table**: Records all customer orders.

**Order_items Table**: Lists the items purchased in each order.

**Products Table**: Contains details of products sold, including price, brand, and product categories.

In this project, I utilized advanced SQL techniques such as subqueries, CTES, and Window Functions to process and analyze e-commerce data for TheLook. I developed and maintained datasets to track key performance indicators such as monthly order volume, customer acquisition, average order value, and product profitability. Additionally, I also performed cohort analysis and created visualizations to explore customer cohorts and user retention and churn patterns over time, providing valuable insights into customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

**Overall Insights:**

Overall, TheLook has recorded a consistent increase in the number of new users each month, indicating the effectiveness of the advertising campaign targeting new users.

However, during the first 4 months after making a purchase or using TheLookâ€™s e-commerce
site, the rate of returning users in the following month is quite low: it fluctuated below 10% from
January 2019 to July 2023 and increased to above 10% in the remaining months of 2023, with
the highest being in the first month after October 2023 at 18.28%.

The customer retention rate is low, and TheLook should consider promotional strategies to
establish and engage a loyal customer base in order to increase revenue from this group and
save on marketing costs.
